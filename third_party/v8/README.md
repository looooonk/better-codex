# `rusty_v8` Consumer Artifacts

This directory wires the `v8` crate to exact-version Bazel inputs.
Bazel consumer builds use:

- upstream `denoland/rusty_v8` release archives on Windows MSVC
- source-built V8 archives on Darwin, GNU Linux, musl Linux, and Windows GNU

Local Cargo builds still use upstream prebuilt `rusty_v8` archives by default.
Selected Cargo CI, release, and package builds override
`RUSTY_V8_ARCHIVE`/`RUSTY_V8_SRC_BINDING_PATH` with Codex release assets. Bazel
sets those variables independently in `MODULE.bazel` to select source-built
local archives and bindings for its consumer builds.

The Bazel `v8` crate feature selection enables V8's in-process sandbox for
Darwin, Linux, and Windows GNU. Windows MSVC remains on upstream non-sandboxed
prebuilts.

Current pinned versions:

- Rust crate: `v8 = =149.2.0`
- Embedded upstream V8 source for Bazel-produced release builds: `14.9.207.2`

## Updating to a new `v8` release

Use this as the maintainer flow for a version bump:

1. Bump the `v8` crate version and refresh `codex-rs/Cargo.lock`.
2. Update the Bazel versioned inputs in `MODULE.bazel`, then refresh the
   matching checksum manifest and generated checksums as described below.
3. Validate the change with the relevant local Cargo and Bazel builds.
4. If this fork needs fresh prebuilt artifacts, document that release process
   alongside the artifact generation change.

When changing the remaining prebuilt `rusty_v8` `http_file` inputs, keep the
checked-in checksum manifest and `MODULE.bazel` in sync. The upstream Codex CI
helpers that automated this were removed from this fork, so prefer the simplest
local Bazel validation that exercises the changed inputs.

The consumer-facing selectors are:

- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_archive_for_target`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_binding_for_target`

Published release assets are expected at the tag:

- `rusty-v8-v<crate_version>`

with these raw asset names:

- `librusty_v8_release_<target>.a.gz`
- `src_binding_release_<target>.rs`

During the sandbox rollout, sandbox-enabled assets are published alongside those
current assets on the same tag, with the Rust crate's sandbox feature suffix in
their raw names:

- `librusty_v8_ptrcomp_sandbox_release_<target>.a.gz`
- `rusty_v8_ptrcomp_sandbox_release_<target>.lib.gz` on Windows MSVC
- `src_binding_ptrcomp_sandbox_release_<target>.rs`

If this fork needs to publish replacement artifacts, the relevant Bazel targets
are:

- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_x86_64_apple_darwin`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_aarch64_apple_darwin`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl`

The same run also builds the matching sandbox pair targets:

- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_x86_64_apple_darwin`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_aarch64_apple_darwin`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl`

The workflow also builds sandbox-enabled
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` archive/binding pairs
from upstream `rusty_v8` source. Those ABI-specific outputs cannot be produced
by Codex's Bazel Windows GNU toolchain.

The Bazel graph pins the same libc++, libc++abi, and llvm-libc source revisions
used by `rusty_v8 v149.2.0`, compiles published artifact targets with
`--config=rusty-v8-upstream-libcxx`, and folds the matching runtime objects into
the final static archive so consumers can link it with the `v8` crate's default
`use_custom_libcxx` feature. The config keeps the object files and the bundled
runtime on Chromium's `std::__Cr` ABI namespace instead of mixing those objects
with the toolchain libc++ default namespace. Bazel consumers use these
source-built targets directly; Cargo release and package builds use the
published copies.

MSVC is not part of the Bazel-produced matrix yet. The repository's current
hermetic Windows C++ platform is `windows-gnullvm`/`x86_64-w64-windows-gnu`, so
it cannot truthfully reproduce upstream's `*-pc-windows-msvc` archives until we
add a real MSVC-targeting C++ toolchain to the Bazel graph.

Release and CI Cargo builds for Darwin and Linux use `RUSTY_V8_ARCHIVE` plus a
downloaded `RUSTY_V8_SRC_BINDING_PATH` to point at those `openai/codex` release
assets directly. We do not use `RUSTY_V8_MIRROR` because the upstream `v8` crate
hardcodes a `v<crate_version>` tag layout, while our artifacts are published
under `rusty-v8-v<crate_version>`.

Do not mix artifacts across crate versions. The archive and binding must match
the exact resolved `v8` crate version in `codex-rs/Cargo.lock`.
